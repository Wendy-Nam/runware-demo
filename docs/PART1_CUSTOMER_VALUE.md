## Intro

Hello everyone, my name is **Seo-A**, a candidate for the Runware Graduate Role.

Today I'll briefly share what value Runware brings to developers — and then jump straight into code and a live demo.

---

## Opening

Most of you here are developers.

You came because you're looking for a better way to solve the pains you face every day.

So, what kind of value can Runware actually give you?

The Hero section makes it clear:

**"Watch how easy it is to build production-ready AI apps with Runware."**

Runware is not just another AI service.

It's an API built for developers, and it guarantees three things:

- **One API Call** – everything with a single API
- **Zero Infrastructure** – no infra management
- **Deploy Anywhere** – ship it anywhere instantly

---

## Problem – Solution

So where do you really feel this value? Let's go through a few familiar pain points:

- **Long latency**: users drop off when results take 15 seconds or more.
- **Different syntax per model/API**: you end up rewriting code again and again.
- **Unpredictable costs**: cloud bills spike, hidden charges creep in.
- **Infra overhead**: GPU setup, server downtime, endless maintenance.

And here's what Runware gives you instead:

> "Image generation takes 15 seconds and users leave."
> 
> → Runware delivers **instant responses** with optimized models and infra. No heavy upfront spend, just speed.

> "Switching models means rewriting all my code."
> 
> → With Runware, **one SDK works for every model**. Just swap a parameter — productivity up, confusion gone.

> "My cloud bill tripled last month for no reason."
> 
> → Runware offers **predictable pricing with no hidden fees**. Even 1,000 images cost less than a cup of coffee. Perfect for startups or scale-ups.

> "My GPU server died over the weekend, and I wasted hours fixing it."
> 
> → Runware handles **autoscaling and ops for you**. You focus on building the product and delivering user value.

## Traditional vs Runware

Hearing it is one thing, but let's compare.

- **Traditional way**: buy GPUs → set up models → solve compatibility → build middleware → keep managing servers.
- **Runware way**: get an API key → call the SDK. Done.

What used to make AI development feel heavy and painful now becomes accessible — even to a beginner.

---

## Developer Experience

Runware API is designed with **developer experience first.**

That's why our motto is simple: **"Built for Developers."**

Here's what you'll experience right away:

1. Copy code from the docs → run it immediately
2. Results show up instantly — no waiting
3. Swap models with just a few parameter (works the same for 312K models)
4. Clear JSON errors tell you exactly what went wrong

Whether it's missing credits or a wrong model name, the feedback is precise.

So instead of getting stuck, you just fix it and move on.
